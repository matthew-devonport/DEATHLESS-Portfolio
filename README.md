Portfolio for a client/friend of mine to help add to my own portfolio.

You can see the site live at it's current state (finished) at:
https://deathless-studio.herokuapp.com/#/

As of 11/03/2020, the site is very close to completion.

As of 27/04/2020, the site is bascially complete. Talking to the client (who is a friend) he keeps second guessing himself on color scheme
and other minor things. I have asked to go remote with him so we can go through it quicker. He is procrastinating with this each time I ask him. It's a paidless project so I am considering the site FINISHED and active until I hear more from him.

As of 10/5/2020, I have got in contact with the client. He requested quite a few style changes. I have completed them. He has requested that I also create the shop for him on Shopify. Once that is done the site will be 100% complete.

I am currently moving onto working on a test project with Udemy to set up E-Commerce sites with React/GraphQL/Strapi/Stripe

From there I will start taking on freelance projects until I find full time work with a company
