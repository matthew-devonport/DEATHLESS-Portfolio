Portfolio for a client/friend of mine to help add to my own portfolio.

You can see the site live at it's current state at:
https://deathless-studio.com/#/

As of 14/5/2020, the customer requested another page for his apparel. I have completed this.
He is requesting a couple of font size changes, we will go through these shortly. I have completed the structure and styling for his shopify site. Once he uploads products onto it, he will advertise the site going live. 
It is now available at: https://deathless-studio.com

I am currently moving onto working on a test project with Udemy to set up E-Commerce sites with React/GraphQL/Strapi/Stripe

From there I will start taking on freelance projects until I find full time work with a company
