         <p className="aboutText">Deathless Studio is created by tattooist/illustrator Matt Parry from Napier NZ.<br /><br /><br />
I have worked with multiple brands and bands from all over the globe. I also illustrate the skate/thrash style artwork for my own clothing line Deathless or Die.<br /><br />
My designs are heavily influenced by 80â€™s skateboard graphics and band flyers/artwork from legends such as Jimbo Phillips, VCJ, pushead and Ric Clayton.<br /><br />
I am currently taking on commission work, fill out the form on the contact me page!<br /><br /><br />
Thanks for looking!</p>
